    <!-- BODY OF STORY GOES HERE - KEEP IT CUTE!-->
        <p> Staten Island has a reputation for being the outcast out of the five New York City boroughs. But if you decide to make the trek to this misunderstood island, you have a high chance of dining at an A-rated restaurant. </p>
        <p> According to data from NYC's Department of Health, 83% of Staten Island's restaurants have had an A-rating since 2015, the most of all the five boroughs. While Manhattan might have had nearly ten times as many restaurants in that time span, its A-rated restaurants made up 80%. </p>

        <!-- DONT FORGET EXPERT QUOTE -->
        <p> "Itâ€™s an interesting finding. A top Health Department priority is to ensure that all New Yorkers in every borough are served food that meets the highest safety standards, and that they have the information they need to make informed decisions about where they eat," said Shari Logan, Assistant Press Secretary at NYC's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. </p>
